# Pathfinder2e_java
## Project Overview
This is a project made with the goal of creating an java app to play a Pathfinder 2e session with a peer to peer network. It should have a way to create character sheets, items and tiles and save them way in a JSON for future use.
## Disclaimer for safety
This is a project made for fun and I am not involved in any way with paizo.
